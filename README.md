## Overview
### What is Converter?
Converter is an app for converting and calculating numbers. It can convert numbers between different radix (bases), for example binary to hexadecimal or decimal numbers and vice versa. It also supports a calculator which can evaluate braces, different radix and even bit-operations!

### Requirements
Computer with MacOS or Windows 10.

### Features
Below is a list with some key features of Converter.
* Base conversion: Convert numbers between different radix (bases), for example binary to hexadecimal or decimal numbers and vice versa
* Calculator: Calculator with support for braces, hexadecimal numbers (use 0x as prefex, example: 0xFF) and bit-operations. Calculator evaluates input in JavaScript therefore any valid JS calculation will be calculated correctly.
* Bit-operations: Use "|" for bit-or, "&" for bit-and and so on.
