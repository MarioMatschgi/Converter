## Overview
### What is Converter?
MenuColorPalettes is a utility app for macOS, Windows and Linux (ToDo: Linux version) for converting numbers between different radixes, calculating and calculating bit-operations. Of course, there are websites ([rapidtables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-binary.html), [binaryhexconverter](https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-binary-converter)) for doing this, but most of them are quiet frustrating to use and they are in your browser, not in a all-in-one standalone application. THIS is where Converter comes in.

### Requirements
Mac, windows or Linux (ToDo: Linux version) computer.
